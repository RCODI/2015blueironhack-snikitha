### Blue Iron Hack Application Description
#### Problem Statement
Find a “safe” and “green” place to rent in West Lafayette.
#### Application Description
My ideal application would first allow the user to select major locations in West Lafayette they would prefer to live close to: the Purdue University campus, Purdue Research Park, etc. 
I would present locations to users on a map and number them in order of distance from their selected landmarks based on
>1. Climate data (climate data online - data.gov)
>2. Crime (west lafayette police dataset - I have yet to locate)
>3. Affordability: can users afford the place? will they be priced out due to rent/utility increases? (annual adjustment factors-data.gov)

I would additionally like to highlight all the bus stops and parks on the map.
